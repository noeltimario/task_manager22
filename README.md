To run this system project using XAMPP, follow these instructions:

1. Install XAMPP
If you haven't already, download and install XAMPP from the official website. XAMPP includes Apache (web server) and MySQL (database server) which are required to run PHP projects.

2. Start XAMPP
Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
Start the Apache server (for web server functionality).
Start the MySQL server (for database functionality).
3. Download and Extract Your Project
Download your project files, if they are not already on your computer.
Extract the contents of your ZIP file (the one you have uploaded) to a directory on your computer, such as:
C:\xampp\htdocs\task_manager22
4. Create a Database (if needed)
If your project requires a database, follow these steps to create it:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
Click Databases on the top menu.
Create a new database, e.g., task_management, using the same name specified in the CREATE DATABASE SQL script (or the project).
Import the database schema if a .sql file is provided (you can upload your task_management.sql if it exists).
5. Configure Database Connection
Open the project files you extracted, specifically the db.php file.
Edit the file to match your local database settings:
php
Copy code
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = ""; // default XAMPP MySQL password is empty
$dbname = "task_management"; // replace with the name of your created database
6. Run the Project
Open your browser and go to http://localhost/task_manager22/index.php (or index.php file in your project folder).
This should launch the homepage of your task manager application.
7. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, consider the following:

Check if Apache and MySQL are running in the XAMPP Control Panel.
Ensure the database configuration (db.php) matches your XAMPP MySQL settings.
